# weather-of-different-cities
In this Project, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Building a website that predicts the weather of different cities :- 
It uses the API "OpenWeatherMap"
It fetches the data Forecasting from JSON file
It collects the real-time temperature value (18°C) in Celsius units, the weather description (clear sky), and finally the user’s city and country (London, GB).

In this a lot of improvement is needed and I'm working on it and I'll be back with an amazing Real time weather website which will display various things.
